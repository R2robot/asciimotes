# About

A script for the Weechat IRC client that adds a command to display ascii emotes/emoji text in a channel.  The inital set of emotes are those I've compiled via copy/paste over time.

# Usage
/emo <emote> [message]
/emo list - shows a list of emote names


# Install

Copy asciimotes.pl to your ~/.weechat/perl directory and run /script load asciimotes.pl. Note you'll have to manually load it each time you start weechat.Copy the file to ~/.weechat/perl/autoload to have it automatically load each time you start Weechat.
